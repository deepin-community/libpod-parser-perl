Description: modules for parsing/translating POD format documents
 This package contains the following mdoules for using Perl5 "pod" (Plain Old
 Documentation).
 .
 "Pod::Parser", which provides a base class for parsing and selecting sections
 of POD documentation from an input stream.
 .
 "Pod::Select", which provides a subclass of Pod::Parser and an exported
 function named "podselect()" to dump selected sections of raw pod
 documentation from an input stream.
 .
 "Pod::PlainText", which is a replacement for "Pod::Text" and the
 corresponding "pod2text()" function. It is derived from the Pod::Parser
 class. As of perl 5.00_58, Pod::PlainText has been re-written by Russ
 Allbery, and has been renamed to Pod::Text in the core Perl distribution
 (replacing the previous implementation of Pod::Text). The Pod::PlainText
 module is still provided with Pod::Parser solely for backward
 compatibility.
 .
 "Pod::InputObjects": Some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for
 advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its name
 and text.
 .
 "Pod::ParseUtils", a module with several object-oriented helpers for POD
 parsing and processing. Probably the most important is Pod::Hyperlink for
 parsing and expanding POD hyperlinks L<...>.
 .
 This distribution is considered to be legacy - it has been superseded by
 Pod::Simple which brings more robustness, unicode and various other benefits.
 It has been removed from perl core after 5.31.0, and is packaged only for
 backward compatibility.
